## Quick Start / Usage

1. Register a new account or log in with an existing user.
2. If the logged-in user does not have a profile yet, create one via Profile â†’ Create Profile.
3. After creating a profile the UI will show "Explore" and "Profile" sections:
    - Explore: Browse other users' portfolios.
    - Profile: View and edit your own profile details, education, avatar, and hobbies.
4. Visit any user's portfolio from the Explore page to view their details.
5. Leave comments (text or image) on other users' portfolios.
6. To remove your account and all related data use the Delete Profile option on your Profile page.

Tips:
- Use the seeded accounts (if provided) to quickly test explore/comment flows.
- Edit education entries from the Profile page to add or update degrees and dates.
- Ensure image uploads meet the configured size/type rules in .env and validation.
